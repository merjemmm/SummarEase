# SummarEase
### Making Long Reads Effortless
This project was created for EECS 487: Natural Language Processing.

We create a hybrid summarization model based on both extractive and abstractive summarization methods. 

It is motivated by people experiencing information overload from having to read lengthy or dense content resulting in 
reader fatigue.

The intention is to empowers readers to save time, improve comprehension, and stay informed across a variety of content types.

A retroactively cleaned version of our code has been added here.
